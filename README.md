# Helpage
Personalised Home page

The repository consists of a very basic html file that contains links to my top visited sites and chrome bookmarks. Although chrome supports bookmarking and adding favorites very efficiently, it still is a little tedious for me to navigate through them and find a specific bookmark until I have a whole page that just contains sites of my interest. 
So with the very fundamental knowledge of html I hosted this on github to make it more accessible for me and to set it as my browser default page without having to change the url several times.

My next goal for this project is to add CSS to it to make it more user friendly.
